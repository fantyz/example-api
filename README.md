# Example API

The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of an as-complete-as-possible basic API written in Go.

It contains the following parts:

* Basic API with:
  - Config
  - Logging (optionally structured)
  - ?
* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Working CICD that:
  - Lints
  - Vets
  - Run unit tests
  - Run integration tests
  - Branch based deployment (TODO/needs infrastructure in place)

## How do I use this?

Make a copy and replace the example endpoints/tests with your own!
